This library isn't actively maintained now. Please, consider usage of Stripe's official library:

https://github.com/stripe/stripe-react-native


If for some reason you cannot migrate to it now. And you can offer with testing new beta versions, please reach me in [discord](https://discord.gg/vmBxnBw) (name: cybergrind#4625). Just PM with github account name + platforms you can check will be enough.
I will ping you when we have something to check.
